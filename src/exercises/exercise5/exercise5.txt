Workshop:

We have just built a really popular app, in exercises 1-4, that allows one to enter text into an input box
and add those entries into a dropdown element. The community has gone cray for this app. Number 1 in the app
store and we all got lambos now. However, we never created a register and login page and this has made
our users very upset! Requirements have come in to create a register page and also a login page.
Gotta give the people what they want so today let's do it!

1) Create a register component that allows the user to enter the following information:
    - Username
    - Email
    - Password
    - Confirm password
    - Store these values so we can use them later
    - Add a register button

2) Create a login page that allows the user to enter the following information:
    - Username or email
    - Password
    - Add a login button

3) Now that our two pages are created, lets add some validation to our pages:
    Register:
    - No fields are empty
    - Email contains @ symbol
    - password and confirm password match

    Login:
    - No fields are empty
    - username or email entered match what was provided when registering
    - password entered match what was provided when registering
